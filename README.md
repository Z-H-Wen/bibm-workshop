## Description

In recent years, deep learning has been spotlighted as the most active research field with its great success in various machine learning communities, such as image analysis, speech recognition, and natural language processing, and now its promising potential is being actively discussed in the field of biomedicine. In particular, a dramatically increasing number of deep learning-based approaches have been proposed in biomedical images and signal processing. However, relatively little application of deep learning has been made in other biomedical areas such as genomics and computational biology due to the difficulty of definition and interpretation of deep learning architecture. Moreover, there are still many challenging tasks with many open problems in deep learning that need to be solved for active use in bioinformatics, biomedicine, and healthcare informatics.

The 4th International Workshop on Deep Learning in Bioinformatics, Biomedicine, and Healthcare Informatics (DLB2H) will be held in conjunction with IEEE International Conference on Bioinformatics and Biomedicine (BIBM) in Seoul, South Korea, at Decenber 16 - 19, 2020. The goal of this workshop is to bring together researchers with expertise of deep learning in bioinformatics, biomedicine, and healthcare informatics and share current cutting-edge deep learning methodologies and its applications. Papers are welcome from the following topics (but not limited to):

- Protein structures
- Gene expression regulations
- Genome-wide association studies
- Protein function prediction
- DNA-protein binding site identification
- Clustering cancer subtypes
- Single-cell clustering
- Cancer diagnosis
- 3D brain reconstruction (MRI/fMRI)
- Tissue image classification/Organ segmentation
- Anomaly detection
- Human activity recognition
- Human behavior monitoring

## Important Dates (Tentative)

## Publication

All accepted papers will be published in the BIBM proceedings and IEEE Digital Library (Xplore).

## Journal Inivitation

Selected high-quality papers will be invited for publication in a [special issue](https://github.com/Z-H-Wen/bibm_workshop_test) of **International Journal of Molecular Sciences (Impact factor: 4.556)**. Authors must extend their camera-ready paper by at least 30% by adding theoretical background and/or foundation, related work, detailed methods, additional experiments (using additional datasets), and/or additional discussion.

## Program

DLB2H will be held on December 16 (Wednesday), 9am - 12pm in Korea standard time (4/6/7pm-7/9/10pm PT/CST/EST, December 15). The program is [here](https://github.com/Z-H-Wen/bibm_workshop_test).
